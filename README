Yagy, Yet Another GUI for Yacas, Yet Another Computer Algebra System


Compilation instructions

On Mac OS X:

Prerequisites:
* yacas framework:
	- to download from here: TBD
	- or compiled from sources from here: http://sourceforge.net/p/yacas/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/
* Qt (tested on version 5.3.2)
	- http://qt-project.org/downloads

Compilation:
* in the YAGY.pro file set the YACAS_PREFIX variable to point a folder with the yacas framework
* create an XCode project:
	- in Terminal go to the folder containing YAGY.pro and run the command:
	  $$PATH_TO_QT_BIN_FOLDER$$/qmake -spec macx-xcode
	- in the same folder YAGY.xcodeproj is created
* open YAGY.xcodeproj and update icons:
	- display YAGY target properties (click on YAGY in the Project Navigator)
	- go to the App Icons section and click on Use Asset Catalog and then confirm migration.
* Run the YAGY target to compile and run app from the build folder (./Debug by default)
	- default configuration is Debug. To change to Release edit the YAGY scheme.

To create a distributable application with Qt frameworks included in the bundle as private frameworks run the following command:
	$$PATH_TO_QT_BIN_FOLDER$$/macdeployqt $$PATH_YAGY_BUILD_FOLDER$$/YAGY.app 
Option -dmg can be added to create a dmg image.
